# OOP example

**Step 1**
- Create an animal class

**Step 2**
- Create a reptile class, inheriting from the animal class

**Step 3**
- Create a snake class that inherits from the reptile class
- At this point, it is multi-level inheritance since the animal is the "grandparent" class for the snake class

**Step 4**
- Create a class that inherits from the snake class
